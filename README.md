This repo contains everything needed to program Nicla Sense ME and to control it from another device. Further documentation can be found on the [Arduino Docs website](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nicla-sense-me).

Nicla Sense ME belongs to Arduino Mbed OS boards and its core is available [here](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed).
The packaged core can also be downloaded from Arduino IDE as 'Arduino Mbed OS Nicla Boards'

## Repo structure

------------
[Arduino_BHY2](Arduino_BHY2) - is the library to be included when making sketches for Nicla. It can be used for configuring bhi's sensors and for retrieving bhi's sensors data either from a sketch running on Nicla (standalone mode)  or from an external device (thorugh ESLOV or BLE). 

In [examples](Arduino_BHY2/examples) there are already working examples for both scenarios:
- Standalone mode - [Standalone](Arduino_BHY2/examples/Standalone/Standalone.ino) exploits bhi's sensors directly from Nicla.
- Control from external device mode - [App](Arduino_BHY2/examples/App/App.ino) waits for external stimuli, coming from ESLOV or BLE channels.
- Upload a Fail Safe Firmware - [Fail_Safe_flasher](Arduino_BHY2/examples/Fail_Safe_flasher/Fail_Safe_flasher.ino) uploads a binary to Anna's QSPIFlash. Pressing the button 3 times, Nicla checks if a Fail Safe firmware is present and, if it is valid, runs it.
------------

[Arduino_BHY2Host](Arduino_BHY2Host) - is the library that an Arduino board should include in order to control the Nicla through the ESLOV port.
  It can also act as a passthrough, to allow the control of Nicla from a PC.
  There is an example for both these use cases in [examples](Arduino_BHY2Host/examples):
  - Act as passthrough - [Passthrough](Arduino_BHY2Host/examples/Passthrough/Passthrough.ino)
  - Control Nicla sensors directly - [Accelerometer](Arduino_BHY2Host/examples/Accelerometer/Accelerometer.ino), [Orientation](Arduino_BHY2Host/examples/Orientation/Orientation.ino), [Temperature](Arduino_BHY2Host/examples/Temperature/Temperature.ino)
  
------------

[bootloader](bootloader)  - contains the source code for Nicla's bootloader.

------------

[tools](tools/bhy-controller) - contains the source code of the command line tool to control Nicla from a PC.
  There is also a webserver mode that allows to control Nicla from a browser on your PC.
  The `bhy-controller` executable files for the main operating systems can be downloaded from the [latest release](https://github.com/arduino/nicla-sense-me-fw/releases/latest#:~:text=Assets).

------------


## Main use cases

### Nicla standalone mode
In this use case, Nicla will be able to control its own sensors without the need for an external host.  
- Make a standalone sketch importing [Arduino_BHY2](Arduino_BHY2) library, follow this [example](Arduino_BHY2/examples/Standalone/Standalone.ino) to write the code.
- Select Nicla Sense ME as the compilation target, then compile and upload.


### Control Nicla from an arduino board through ESLOV
- Upload the [App](Arduino_BHY2/examples/App/App.ino) example to Nicla.
- Use an Arduino board, like a MKR, acting as a host by importing [Arduino_BHY2Host](Arduino_BHY2Host) and following the [example](Arduino_BHY2Host/examples/Accelerometer/Accelerometer.ino).
- Upload the host sketch to the Arduino MKR board.
- Connect Nicla to the MKR board with an ESLOV cable or I2C pins.


### Control Nicla from a PC - web server 
A local web server has been implemented to manage Nicla from a browser. See [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API#browser_compatibility).

BLE is used instead of ESLOV, thus there is no need for an intermediary arduino board.
- Upload the [App](Arduino_BHY2/examples/App/App.ino) example to Nicla.
- Access the command line tool folder.
- Execute the following command `./bhy webserver` to start the local web server.
- Open the `http://localhost:8000/index.html` web page with a browser listed in the compatibility list.
  NB: make sure that WebBLE is enabled! If it is not, enable it from chrome://flags, setting "Experimental Web Platform features".

There are two web pages
- `sensor.html` allows to configure the sensors and read their values in real time.
- `dfu.html` allows to update the firmware of either Nicla or bhi.


### Control Nicla from a PC - command line tool
The command line tool can be used to update the firmware of Nicla or bhi, manage Nicla's sensors and read their values in real time. Refer to [tools](tools/bhy-controller) for the list of available commands. 
Here the ESLOV protocol is employed, so an arduino board is needed between Nicla and the PC.
- Upload the [App](Arduino_BHY2/examples/App/App.ino) example to Nicla.
- Upload the [Passthrough](Arduino_BHY2Host/examples/Passthrough/Passthrough.ino) example to an arduino board.
- Connect the arduino board to your PC via USB.
- Connect the arduino board to Nicla through the ESLOV port.
- Access the command line tool folder
- Refer to [tools](tools/bhy-controller) for the list of available commands.


### Update Nicla firmware
The procedure to update the firmware is the same for both bhi and Nicla. You just need to specify the target during the procedure.
#### Update procedure through BLE:
- Follow these steps [Control Nicla from a PC - web server](#control-nicla-from-a-pc---web-server).
- Select _**DFU**_ in the page located at `http://localhost:8000/index.html` - or directly go to `http://localhost:8000/dfu.html`.
- Select the target (bhi or nicla).
- Select the .bin firmware file.
- Click on update and wait for the transfer to complete.
Then, Nicla will reset and the firmware will be updated.

#### Update procedure through ESLOV:
- Follow [Control Nicla from a PC - command line tool](#control-nicla-from-a-pc---command-line-tool)
- Execute the command `./bhy dfu -p YOUR_PORT -t TARGET -bin BIN_FILE`
    * Replace `YOUR_PORT` with the serial port used by the arduino board
    * Replace `TARGET` with `nicla` or `bhi`
    * Replace `BIN_FILE` with the path of the binary file to bu uploaded
- Nicla will reset and the firmware will be updated
