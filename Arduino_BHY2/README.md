# Bosch BHY2 Sensor Library for Arduino

The Bosch BHY2 Sensor Library provides an interface with the [Bosch BHY2-Sensor-API](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BHY2-Sensor-API) for communicating with the BHI260AP and a custom library for the BME688 sensors of the Nicla Sense ME.

See [docs/readme.md](docs/readme.md) for usage and examples.
